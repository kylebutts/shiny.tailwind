# shiny.tailwind

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/shiny.tailwind)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny.tailwind)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `shiny.tailwind` is to bring [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to Shiny apps. 


## Installation

You can install the package with:

``` r
install.packages("shiny.tailwind")
# development version
# remotes::install_github("kylebutts/shiny.tailwind")
```


## Basic Use 

In your shiny UI declaration, just include `shiny.tailwind::use_tailwind()` and all the appropriate files will be inserted into your shiny app. Therefore you can just start using tailwind classes and they will load dynamically and automatically.

If you want to compile your used tailwindcss classes to a local css file, see the [Details](#details-about-shinytailwind) section.

`shiny.tailwind` also allows you to use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components. See also the examples 

- daisyUI: `system.file("examples", "07-daisyUI", package = "shiny.tailwind")` and
- flowbite: `system.file("examples", "08-flowbite", package = "shiny.tailwind")`


## Example

Here is a basic example. 

<img src="man/figures/README-example.png" width="100%" />

Here is the example code. Note how easy it is to use tailwind classes with `shiny.tailwind::use_tailwind()`

``` r
library(shiny)
library(shiny.tailwind)
# there is a bug (at the moment), that tailwind does not render correctly in the
# RStudio viewer, the following code uses your default browser
options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram using HTML divs and tailwind
ui <- div(
  class = "px-4 py-10 max-w-6xl mx-auto",
  # Load Tailwind CSS Just-in-time
  use_tailwind(),
  
  # apply tailwind classes to existing classes, in this case the slider input
  tags$style(type = "text/tailwindcss","
  .irs-single {@apply bg-pink-500 !important;}
  .irs-bar {@apply bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 border-none !important;}
  "),
  
  # Title
  div(class = "flex flex-col w-full text-center py-12",
      h1(
        class = paste(
          "text-6xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-transparent bg-clip-text",
          "bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500"
        ),
        "Old Faithful"
      )
  ),
  
  # Inputs
  div(class = "flex gap-2 shadow-md py-4 px-4 flex flex-row rounded-md bg-stone-50",
      twSliderInput("bins", "Number of Bins:", min = 1, max = 10, value = 5,
                    label_class = "font-bold"),
      twTextInput("title", "Title", value = "Histogram of Eruptions",
                  label_class = "font-bold",
                  input_class = "rounded-md border border-2 border-stone-200"),
      twTextInput("xlab", "x-Axis Label", value = "Waiting Time",
                  label_class = "font-bold",
                  input_class = "rounded-md border border-2 border-stone-200"),
      twTextInput("ylab", "y-Axis Label", value = "Frequency",
                  label_class = "font-bold",
                  input_class = "rounded-md border border-2 border-stone-200")
  ),
  
  # Plot
  div(class = "block shadow-md rounded-md py-4 px-4 mt-4 bg-stone-50",
      plotOutput("distPlot")
  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram, does not use shiny.tailwind
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[, 2]
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
    par(bg = NA) # remove white background of plot
    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = "#ec4899", border = "white",
         main = input$title, xlab = input$xlab, ylab = input$ylab)
  })
}

# Run the application
if(interactive()) shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Additional examples are found in the `inst/examples/` folder, eg

```R
library(shiny)
library(shiny.tailwind)

list.files(system.file("examples", package = "shiny.tailwind"))
runApp(system.file("examples", "01-old-faithful", package = "shiny.tailwind"))
```


## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a *utility-based* CSS framework that allows really quick and incredibly customizable styling of html all through classes. Here are some example classes

- `my-4` which sets the **m**argin top and bottom (ie the **y** coordinates) to size `4` (Tailwind has sizes that are consistent across classes. 4 happens to be `1rem`). See also [docs/margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin).
- `shadow-sm`/`shadow-md`/`shadow-lg`/`shadow-xl` set a drop shadow on divs. See also [docs/box-shadow](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow).
- `text-left`/`text-center`/`text-right` left/center/right- align text. See also [docs/text-align](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-align).
- `w-#/12` sets a column of width #/12 (similar to bootstrap's grid). See also [docs/width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width).
- [Much, much more](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).

For example, the following UI code would create a div that has a margin of 4 tailwind units vertically (`my-4`), a large shadow (`shadow-lg`) and has a width of 3/12 (`w-3/12`):

```R
div(
  class = "my-4 shadow-lg w-3/12",
  ... # put the contents of the box here.
)
```

This makes a common framework for designing that is quick and intuitive.


## Details about `shiny.tailwind`

TailwindCSS is a utility-based design framework that makes designing simple. There is basically a class for every css idea you could have. However, the complete set of tailwind css classes is massive (~15mb), so you don't want to load all of these. That is where Tailwind's new Just in Time compiling comes in. It will only load the css classes you use, as you use them. So if your shiny app renders ui dynamically, it will load just the css needed whenever the UI is rendered.

Normally, doing just in time requires a fancy node setup that is constantly monitoring html in a terminal. However, the company Beyond Code created a browser version of Tailwind Just in Time that runs completely in JS in the browser. See <https://beyondco.de/blog/tailwind-jit-compiler-via-cdn>. Therefore, you can just use tailwind css classes and they will load automatically.

If you need to work offline or do not want to have the live-connection required to tailwinds CDN, you can also install and use the CLI which will compile the required css to a local file.
See also:

- `?install_tailwindcss_cli()` to install the CLI (the program is around 15MB and platform dependent),
- `?compile_tailwindcss()` to compile the files to a local CSS (replaces the logic of `use_tailwind()` instead the local CSS can be included),
- or the `03-css-generation` example (`system.file("examples", "03-css-generation", package = "shiny.tailwindcss")`).


### Custom css and the `@apply` directive: 

Writing css in Tailwind is incredibly easy too, with the [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) directive. For example, lets say you want to create a blue button class, say `.btn-blue`. I can use the `@apply` directive to automatically use a bunch of TailwindCSS utility classes:

```css
.btn-blue {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white;
}
```

Setting `class = "btn-blue"` is equivalent to setting `class = "bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white"`. 

You can write custom css files for your shiny app, you just need to pass them through `use_tailwind()` in order to use the apply directive. Just pass `use_tailwind(css = "custom.css")` and the @apply directive will work automatically. (Technical note, the `<style>` tag that holds the custom.css needs the property `type='postcss'` in order to work, and use_tailwind does this automatically.)

See also the [`05-apply-directive`](https://github.com/kylebutts/shiny.tailwind/blob/master/inst/examples/05-apply-directive/app.R), which you can run with 

```r
runApp(system.file("examples", "05-apply-directive", package = "shiny.tailwind"))
```


### Reusing Classes

As the [official tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles) puts it, the best way to reuse classes is to define loops and components. For example, let's say we want to have a multiple containers with the classes `p-2 bg-stone-200 border border-gray-600 rounded-md drop-shadow-md`, we could either re-type this string every time, or use something along the lines of this:

```r
mybox <- function(...) {
  div(
    class = "p-2 bg-stone-200 border border-gray-600 rounded-md drop-shadow-md",
    ...
  )
}

# in UI:
div(
  class = "flex flex-wrap",
  mybox("This is the first box"),
  mybox("This is a second box"),
  mybox("This is a third box"),
)
```


### Customizing Tailwind

Custom configuration of Tailwind is also possible. There are two options available in ‘use_tailwind', but moving forward the option `tailwindConfig` will be the only one supported (with version 3.0 of Tailwind). See [this release](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.1) for details, but you need to define `tailwind.config = {}` as a JSON object. An example is in the folder 'inst/examples/01-old-faithful' in the github repository. Note the '.js' file should only consist of the JSON object. The function will place it in the appropriate script tag. For details on all the ways you can configure Tailwind, see [this page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) in their docs.

Version 3 of tailwind (the default by `use_tailwind`) will come loaded with all first-party plugins from Tailwind, i.e. Typography, Aspect Ratio, Forms, Line-clamp. 

For version 2, if you want to use custom modules, for example TailwindTypography, note that you need to use the browser-version and you have to layout the config file in a specific way. You need to define the config JSON object as 'window.tailwindConfig' and you must call 'window.tailwindCSS.refresh();'.
